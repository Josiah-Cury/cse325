The greatest difficulty we faced during this lab was reading reading chapter 5
in the xv6 book.

Other than that, we had a small bug in the priority scheduler. When we first
implemented the scheduler, we chose only one process at a time in the 
scheduler() method. This led to problems such as not being able to run the ps
command. To remedy this issue, we created a nested loop to iterate through all
processes and search for the highest priority in succession.
