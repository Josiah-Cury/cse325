The biggest difficulty I encountered was an error in priority scheduling. My
partner and I took the time to work through and discuss the error and come to
a solution. 

The only other difficulty, that was self imposed, is that we decided to use git
to collaborate. My partner helped me set up a remote git to expedite our
productivity and improve collaboration.


Peer Evaluation:

My partner and I evenly divided the work and assisted each other. They also
helped me set up a git so that way we could collaborate. The project went very
well and there were no issues as a team!
