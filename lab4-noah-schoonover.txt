This lab was quite difficult, but I made it through. I spent a lot of time 
searching through the xv6 kernel to make sure I understood every step of 
the existing implementations so that I could modify them for this lab.
I came across an issue where my threads were printing garbage, but I fixed this
issue by remembering to not free the page table in thread_join.
